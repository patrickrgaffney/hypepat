Title: Acknowledgments

During the development of this site I was able to use quite a few open source projects.  I owe a lot to their ingenuity -- each of them have saved me hours of attempting to hack together a half-assed solution.

- Site was built using [Pelican][pelly], built by [Justin Mayer][justin_mayer].
- All content was written in [Markdown][md], all thanks to the [Most High][gruber].
	- Footnotes, fenced code blocks, and abbreviations from [PHP Markdown Extra][md_extra].
- Syntax Highlighting is powered by [Pygments][pygments].

A sincere thank you to the developers who spent time working on these projects.
