### About hypepat

I have been sitting on this URL for a while now, not really sure what to make of it.  I really wanted a simple website with the ability to publish blog posts on topics that interest me, as a way to focus some of my ramblings that refuse to be contained within [140 characters][twitter].

[^1]: Or to start a [reddit][reddit] [flame war][reddit2].

One day I'll do a write-up on the odyssey that was the making of this site, but in case you were wondering, this site was:

- Designed on a Macbook.
- Coded in [TextMate][mate].
- Build using [Pelican][pelly], the Python static site engine.
- Purchased and managed through [Hover][hover].
- Hosted on a VPS at [Digital Ocean][digitalocean].

To get in touch with me, find me on [Twitter][twitter] or send me an [email][email_subj].
