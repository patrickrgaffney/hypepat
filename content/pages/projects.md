## patdown

`patdown` is a [Markdown][md] *compiler* written in C. It aims to be [CommonMark][cm] compliant in its parsing. Currently it's still very much a work in progress and isn't fully compliant with the standard.

## nba.py

`nba.py` is a small command-line interface to NBA box scores. It was written in Python and is mostly outdated.

## Dotfiles

My personal collection of dotfiles is hosted on [Github][dotfiles]. They are ever-evolving, but contain a lot of useful stuff if you work with `bash`, `git`, Terminal.app, TextMate, `nano`, or Python. I wrote about customizing `bash` with startup files in an [article once][bash] â€” it contains a lot of the rationale behind my `bash` settings.

## Stopwatch.app

[Stopwatch.app][stopwatch] is a *kind-of* feature complete clone of the Stopwatch app for iOS. It implements all of the features that ship in the iOS standard application. The app is written in Swift 3 and built in XCode 8.0.
