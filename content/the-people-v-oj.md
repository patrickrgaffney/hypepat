Summary: Stop what you are doing and go watch *The People v. O.J. Simpson*.  And then go buy some Courtney B. Vance stock.

I was 4 years old when the *trial of the century* began, so I didn't know Kato Kaelin from the dude with the mask on [the Green Hornet][kato].  If you asked me about A.C., I would tell you I think the temperature is fine.  This is all to say that everything I knew about this trial could be summed up in two words: *not guilty*.  I have no perceived notions about O.J.'s innocence, and I have no problem devoting ten hours of my Monday nights to what I can only assume will be a B-grade, movie-of-the-week, dramatic telling of his trial.  Hell, I spent half my Christmas break [rummaging through a junk yard in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin][murderer].

Holy shit.  Man was I wrong.  *The People v. O.J. Simpson* is incredible television.

The series doesn't open with a bang, though.  The first episode stutters, in large part to the bumbling Ross Geller--err--Herbet Sobel--shit--David Schwimmer, who can't seem to take a breath without bellowing *JUUUUUUIIIIICE* as though his life and our eternal hatred depended on it.  He brings such *JUUUUUUIIIIICE* to the role that I can't help but pray for a commercial break.

I stuck it out though, in large part to the [rave reviews][metacritic], and by the time that Bronco hits the 405 in episode two, I was down the rabbit-hole.  Then, in an ultimate balance of the scales, we are blessed with Courtney B. Vance as Johnnie Cochran.  Vance is so good he makes you forget *JUUUUUUIIIIICE* ever existed.  The screen literally brightens with his presence; he unleashes a beast in some of the courtroom scenes that would make Aaron Sorkin cry.

Sarah Paulson is also particularly stellar as Marcia Clark; her *centric*-episode *Marcia, Marcia, Marcia* is a standout.  Paulson and Vance's battles are some of the best I have ever seen on television. [^lost]  I would watch the two of them sell blenders.

[^lost]: I would safely put the two of them in the [Jack/Locke][lost] and [Josh/Donna][west wing] tier of TV tandems.

In essence, the cast delivers, the direction is stylized, the writing superb, and the *manna* from heaven.  Driven by an accelerating story that is accurate and imaginative, I cannot recommend this show enough. I'll take five more seasons of this please.
