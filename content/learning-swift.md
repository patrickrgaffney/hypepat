Summary: Getting the ball rolling with Swift, or at least making an attempt.

I started working through Apple's [*The Swift Programming Language*][swift-book] about a month ago, and I fell into a groove with Swift almost immediately.  Writing Swift feels familiar --- almost like I'm writing in some intermediate language between C and Python.

I have zero experience writing Objective-C, so I'll avoid making direct comparisons.  What I will say is Swift reads a hell of a whole lot better than Objective-C.  Sometimes I end up using Github like StumbleUpon [^stumble] and I find myself staring at a 3,000 line Objective-C file.  The whole goddamn thing is [covered in square brackets][objc-brackets], and there are seemingly random references to `id` [everywhere][objc-id].  I've never been more terrified in my life.

[^stumble]: What ever happened to StumbleUpon?  Days (probably weeks) of my life were wasted hitting the **stumble** button and staring blankly at the screen.  More cat pics?  Ice cubes that look like Hitler?  Someone made a mashup of the Cheers theme song and Yeezus?

Swift reads very *cleanly* --- almost like pseudocode.  I have spent the last few weekends with this brand new language, and I'm confident I could stumble my way through someone else's code at this point.  Comparatively, disregarding my feelings for bracketed markup, I feel lost when I read Objective-C. [^objc]

[^objc]: I have tried to force myself to get into Objective-C a few different times now, but it never took.  It feels like an ancient language.  I usually get an hour into some tutorial or walkthrough and next thing I'm looking up [bridges for Ruby][macruby].  I'm a student of the [University of Siracusa][copeland], and I feel like I should be afforded some memory protection.

I love the idea of getting in on the ground floor of something --- potentially shaping the idioms that come out of this community in the next few years.  When I started learning Python, this was the biggest struggle for me.  I had rather basic experience in C and Java, and it seemed like there were all these *gotchas* to writing Python code.  Somehow everyone knew the ins-and-outs of `for-in` loops, and I'm over here writing index variables.  Later I realized there was a [pythonic][pythonic] way of doing things.  Swift doesn't really have this yet, and so far it seems like [one of those good problems to have][marlo].

## What A Time To Be Alive

All of this is a means to an end, and I'm afraid I have ulterior motives. I'm attempting to teach myself Cocoa development. [^cocoa]  I've been using Macs for 7 years now, and I want to try my hand at some GUI application development.  I'm a little tired of building command-line scripts, no matter how useful they are.

[^cocoa]: Everyone else is building mobile applications, and the desktop market is (supposedly) shrinking.  Big thumbs up for desktop application development!  Woo!

I bought Big Nerd Ranch's *Cocoa Programming for OS X* [book][big-nerd], and I'm going to work through it slowly at night. [^school] I'm sure I'll hit that [programmer's block][block] soon, but I haven't been this excited about a language since I was halfway through Mark Pilgrim's [*Dive Into Python 3*][diveintopy].  Either way, these are [exciting times][drake].

[^school]: After I get tired of learning about all those things my University deems I know.  You know, topics most employers look for on a resume.  Currently on the slate: Advanced Linear Algebra and Discrete Mathematics.  Ugh.
