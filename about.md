I'm Pat Gaffney, a software developer in St. Louis. I studied computer science at a small college *you've never heard of* — while there I earned a pathetic but acceptable GPA. Now I build full-stack apps for a giant agricultural company.

### About hypepat

The term *hypepat* is kind of a joke — "hi pat". But I have been known to be unusually energetic, mostly about the wrong things.

As far as the site itself, some facts:

- designed and not-tested on a 2016 TouchBar Macbook Pro.
- coded in [TextMate][mate].
- syntax highlighting via [Pygments][pygments].
- less markup, more *markdown* thanks to the [most high][gruber].
- built using [Jekyll][jekyll], the infamous Ruby static site engine.
- domain purchased and managed through [Hover][hover].
- hosted on a [FreeBSD][bsd] VPS at [Digital Ocean][digitalocean].

### Elsewhere

I exist elsewhere on the internet:

- [@patrickrgaffney on Github][github]
- [@hypepat on lobste.rs][lobsters]
- [@patrickrgaffney on Twitter][twitter]
- [@hypepat on letterboxd][letterboxd]
- [@hypepat on GoodReads][goodreads]

Or, you could [email me][mailto] (but please don't).

Thanks for reading.
