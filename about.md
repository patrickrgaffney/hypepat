I'm Pat Gaffney, an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the [University of Missouri - St. Louis][UMSL].

### About hypepat

One day I'll do a write-up on the odyssey that was the making of this site, but in case you were wondering, this site was:

- Designed on a Macbook.
- Coded in [TextMate][mate].
- Build using [Pelican][pelly], the Python static site engine.
- Purchased and managed through [Hover][hover].
- Hosted on a VPS at [Digital Ocean][digitalocean].

To get in touch with me, find me on [Twitter][twitter] or send me an [email][email_subj].

My resume is also [available as a PDF][pdf].
